# PBFLookup
A tool to identify a likely position in Sweden described in texts in Swedish.
## Building the Software
### Requirements
The software is written in **C++**, so a compiler toolchain to compile C++ code is required. The software has been tested and developed on *Linux* using GNU GCC's *C++ compiler*.

The software makes use of a number of libraries, including:

* [Protocol Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/) -- Google's data interchange format. Most Linux distributions offer packages for this library under the name `protobuf`. Any recent version should be sufficient.
* [zlib](http://www.zlib.net/) -- a standard (de)compression library. Often already installed as numerous programs make use of this library. Any recent version should be sufficient.
* [Boost](http://www.boost.org/) -- a versatile collection of C++ libraries. Like zlib, this library is often installed due to its widespread use. Any recent version should be sufficient.
* [libconfig](http://www.hyperrealm.com/libconfig/) -- a library for 	processing of structured configuration files. Version 1.6.1 (yet to be released, alternatively use `master` from [project's Git repository](https://github.com/hyperrealm/libconfig)) is required. Some distributions provide outdated packages (e.g. version 1.5), so please the distribution packages maintainers for an update.
* [OSMPBF](https://github.com/scrosby/OSM-binary) -- a Java/C library to read and write OpenStreetMap PBF files. Unfortunately, there is no stable, official release which contains the changes/features required by PBFLookup. Please use the master branch at [Thomas Fischer's fork](https://github.com/thomasfischer-his/OSM-binary) for the time being. At the time of writing, distributions do not ship packages for this library.

In addition to above libraries, to configure the software before the actual compilation, [CMake](https://cmake.org/) is required. Due to the tool's popularity, virtually all distributions ship packages.

### Configuration

Once the required libraries and tools are installed, the software can be configured. Here, configuration means that it is check if and where the required libraries are installed. To configure the software, simply run (no root permissions required):

```bash
cmake
```

On Linux, if successful, a `Makefile` will be generated used in the actual compilation.

### Compilation

To compile the software, simply execute

```bash
make -j4
```

The switch `-j4` tells `make` to parallize the compilation to 4 CPU cores. In case of doubt, this parameter can be omitted.

### Installation

It is not necessary (and at the time of writing not supported) to *install* the software in a special location, it can be run from the directory where the binary is located.

## Running the Software

### Downloading Map Data
A requirement to run the software is a current snapshot of the OpenStreetMap data for Sweden. Such a snapshot is available at [Geofabrik](http://download.geofabrik.de/europe/sweden.html), a company providing services based on OpenStreetMap data.

At the time of writing, the latest snapshot for Sweden in the required `.osm.pbf` format is available at [http://download.geofabrik.de/europe/sweden-latest.osm.pbf](http://download.geofabrik.de/europe/sweden-latest.osm.pbf). As the map of Sweden gets updated regularly by [active contributors](http://www.openstreetmap.org/), it is recommended to download a new snapshot about once per month.

### Editing the Configuration File

PBFLookup ships with a default configuration file: `sweden.config`

The configuration file has a simple structure, empty lines and lines starting with a hash symbol (`#`) will be ignored. Other configuration files can be included using the `@include` statement. The actual configuration entries are key-value pairs, separated by an equal sign, i.e. `key=value`. Reasonable default values will be assumed for configuration entries not set in the configuration file.

The most common configuration options include:

* `mapname` should be set to `sweden`, no need to be changed.
* `osmpbffilename` is by default the value of `mapname` followed by `-latest.osm.pbf`, i.e. exactly the name as the OpenStreetMap data downloaded from GeoFabrik.
* `tempdir` where temporary files are stored. By default `/tmp` is used.
* `logfile` where log messages (in most cases the same as shown during program execution) are written to. By default, a file in the temporary directory is used, containing the map name and the current timestamp in its name.
* `stopwordfilename` contains more than 400 words (one word per line, UTF-8-encoded) from the Swedish language that should get skipped when processing text as those words are most likely not referring to a geographic location. Examples include *v√•ra* or *vilken*.

A number of example testsets are included through the statement

```
@include "testsets-sweden.config"
```

Simply disable or remove this line to skip running those tests.
